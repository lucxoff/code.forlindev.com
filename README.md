# Description
This site aims to share code easily between developers in the [Forlindev](https://discord.gg/yrAVgBYRTx) community.<br>
Copy/Paste your code and then save it to have a link to share it.

## TODO: 
- Make a versioning system. A user has the possibility to see a code via the link and by modifying it create another version. The user who created the code would be able to see the previous versions
- Redo the system of numbers of the lines of code so that it adapts to the responsiveness.
- Add shortcuts to code directly on the site (ex: tab etc)
- Make a light theme

## Library: 
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- [Highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/)

## Framework:
- [Symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony)

## Pull request:
If you want to do something about this github, just fork it and make a pull request. I will maintain the repo until the todo is complete.
